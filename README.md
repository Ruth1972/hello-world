# "hello-world"
Hi there!
I literally live on a small volcanic island, not quite under a rock so much as actually on one.
It's in the sea, near the coast of Morocco, just north and west of the Western Sahara. That's not me in the video, but I hope you can get a little idea of what this wonderful Spanish island is like. Â¡Bienvenidos!
